  # GitLab service Docker in Docker configuration
  #
  # GitLab Docker dind service starts a separate container with dockerd,
  # links 2376 tcp port to a container where the job is executing and
  # Docker clients (cli and python) interacts with it over TCP+TLS. That
  # adds the requirement to share TLS certificates between containers.
  #
  # To use dind, make sure gitlab-runner's configuration
  # has a common mount for /certs (i.e. runners.docker.volumes) directory
  # and that the dind service name is always docker (default hostname).
